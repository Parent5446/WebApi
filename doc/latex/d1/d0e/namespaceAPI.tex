Tags take the following form: $<$!options\mbox{[}\mbox{[}tagname\mbox{]}\mbox{]}$>$ replacing options with a comma separated list of options and tagname with the name of the tag.

For options, each option is delimited by a comma, and requires an option name. If '=' and then a value is placed after the option name, the value following the equals sign is assigned as the option value. Valid options are: $\ast$ array=separator -\/ The value given to the template will be an array. Implode the array using the given separator. $\ast$ switch -\/ If set, instead of using the value in the template, determine which of two static values to use, either the switch\_\-true option if \$value is true, or the switch\_\-false option if false. $\ast$ noescape -\/ Do not escape HTML characters in the value $\ast$ trim=4 -\/ Trim the value to the given number of characters $\ast$ padding=2 -\/ Pad the value to the given number of characters $\ast$ padvalue=\par
 -\/ Use the given value to pad the value rather than spaces $\ast$ template -\/ Instead of inserting data from the database, it inserts another template
