There must be a configuration file, even if blank, named <name of plugin>.conf,
replacing <name of plugin> with the name of the plugin. Furthermore, a file with
the same name except with a php extension (<name of plugin>.php) must contain the
PHP code for the plugin.

Before creating a plugin, be sure to check out the interface for WebApi compatible
plugins in app/main/Config.php. This interface is for easy implementation of plugins.
It is not mandatory for a plugin to implement this interface, but it is to the
developer's advantage. IF YOU DECIDE TO USE THIS INTERFACE, YOUR MAIN PLUGIN CLASS
MUST BE NAMED "PLUGIN_<name of plugin>", JUST HOW IT WAS IN THE FILE NAMES.
