<p>This program was created to make a set of classes to be used for easy website creation. Usage: simply extend the DB_Object class to make models and the <a class="el" href="../../de/d53/classOUT__Request.html">OUT_Request</a> class to make controllers. HTML is stored in templates with special tags. See the <a class="el" href="../../d0/dcf/classOUT__Template.html">OUT_Template</a> class for more details.

<p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see &lt;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>&gt;. Loads an HTML template from a local file, and replaces specific tags with the given values.</p>
<p>Tags take the following form: &lt;!options[[tagname]]&gt; replacing options with a comma separated list of options and tagname with the name of the tag.</p>
<p>For options, each option is delimited by a comma, and requires an option name. If '=' and then a value is placed after the option name, the value following the equals sign is assigned as the option value. Valid options are: * array=separator - The value given to the template will be an array. Implode the array using the given separator. * switch - If set, instead of using the value in the template, determine which of two static values to use, either the switch_true option if $value is true, or the switch_false option if false. * noescape - Do not escape HTML characters in the value * trim=4 - Trim the value to the given number of characters * padding=2 - Pad the value to the given number of characters * padvalue=<br/>
 - Use the given value to pad the value rather than spaces * template - Instead of inserting data from the database, it inserts another template</p>
