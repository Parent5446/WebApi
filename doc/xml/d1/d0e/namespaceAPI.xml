 - Use the given value to pad the value rather than spaces * template - Instead of inserting data from the database, it inserts another template</para><para><simplesect kind="author"><para>Tyler Romeo &lt;<ulink url="mailto:tylerromeo@gmail.com">tylerromeo@gmail.com</ulink>&gt;  <ulink url="http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html</ulink> GNU General Public License 3.0  Copyright (c) 2009, Tyler Romeo (Some Rights Reserved) </para></simplesect>
